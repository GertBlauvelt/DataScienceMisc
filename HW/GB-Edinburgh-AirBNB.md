## Exercises

### Exercise 1

there are 13245 entries in the data set.

### Exercise 2

each row represesnts a different AirBNB in Edinurgh.

### Exercise 3

facet wrapped to 4 rows, since it seemed to make the graphs large enough
to be visible, and filtered to prices \< 500, so that the bulk of the
data is actually large enough to compare.

``` r
ggplot(data = edibnb %>% filter(price < 300), mapping = aes(x = price))+
  geom_histogram(stat = "bin", binwidth = 20)+
  facet_wrap(~neighbourhood, nrow = 4)
```
