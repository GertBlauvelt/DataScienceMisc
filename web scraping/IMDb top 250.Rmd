Step 1. Read the whole page

```{r}
page <- read_html("https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/")
page

typeof(page) #in the slideshow, it says this is a list, not a closure
class(page) #i've gotten lost here --- yup this has turned into an issue
```

Step 2. Scrape the nodes

```{r}
page %>%
  html_nodes(".titleColumn a")


```
